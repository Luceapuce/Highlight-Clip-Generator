# Gameplay Highlight Clip Generator
## Introduction
A basic personal project to export a trimmed gameplay clip from videos taken using Nvidias instant replay service to a specified highlights folder. 

The program will append `_EDITED` to the end of the original clip's name to show that it is safe to delete.
